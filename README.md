Curious how many people you know will die due to COVID-19, based on how seriously we and the government take the crisis? 

Each plot represents a different level of closeness. 
Left: your close friends and family. 
Middle: add in people you know reasonably well, like occasional friends and coworkers. 
Right: add in casual acquaintances.

In each plot, there are three solid lines. 
Blue: policy and compliance reflect the severity of the crisis. 
Yellow: moderate measures taken as we are currently doing (estimate from Imperial College report). 
Red: we try to "save the economy." This one also takes into account deaths due to other causes that would have been prevented were hospitals not overrun with coronavirus patients.

For each category of social closeness, a point (x, y) on each line means that there is 
a y% chance that at least x people you know (in that category) will die. 
The black dashed line is a coin flip: there is a 50% chance that the number of people 
you know who die is at least where the solid line intersects the dashed line and a 50% 
chance that it's less.

For example, the middle graph (friends, family, coworkers) indicates that if effective 
measures are taken, there is a 50% chance that no one you know in this category will die 
(and 50% chance that at least 1 person dies). 
If moderate measures are taken, there is a 50% chance that at fewer than 4 people you 
know will die (and 50% chance that it's at least 4). 
If we try to "save the economy," there is a 50% chance that fewer than 12 people you know 
will die (and 50% chance that it's at least 12).

A few caveats with this extremely simplified model:
- It assumes typical distribution of age and health of people in your social circles
- It doesn't take into account where in the US you live
- The best predictions for death toll are constantly evolving; the optimistic projection may not be optimistic enough
- The more you check in on family and friends and encourage them to be smart and safe, the lower your individual lines will be!
